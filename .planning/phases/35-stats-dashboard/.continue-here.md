<current_state>
Phase 35 execution was just started. Orchestrator validated the phase, discovered 3 plans across 3 waves, and was about to spawn the first executor for plan 35-01. No code has been written yet — this is a clean start point.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**Orchestrator setup:**
- Validated phase directory: `.planning/phases/35-stats-dashboard/`
- Found 3 plans: 35-01 (wave 1), 35-02 (wave 2), 35-03 (wave 3, checkpoint)
- Confirmed model profile: balanced (executor=sonnet, verifier=sonnet)
- No existing SUMMARYs — all plans are incomplete
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Wave 1 (35-01: Stats CLI Enhancement)**
- Task 1: Create IndexStats dataclass and comprehensive stats collection
- Task 2: Enhance CLI stats command with visual output and new flags
- Task 3: Add unit tests for new stats functionality

**Wave 2 (35-02: HTTP API + Terminal Dashboard)**
- Task 1: Add /api/stats HTTP endpoint to MCP server
- Task 2: Create terminal dashboard module with Rich Layout
- Task 3: Add --live and --watch flags to CLI stats command

**Wave 3 (35-03: Web Dashboard - CHECKPOINT)**
- Task 1: Create web dashboard HTML with Chart.js
- Task 2: Add /dashboard route to MCP server
- Task 3: Add serve-dashboard CLI command
- Task 4: Human verification checkpoint

This is Phase 35: Stats Dashboard. The goal is to provide index observability via:
1. Enhanced CLI (`cocosearch stats`) with Unicode bars, warnings, -v/--json/--all flags
2. Terminal dashboard (`--live`, `--watch`) using Rich Layout for htop-style multi-pane display
3. HTTP API at `/api/stats` for programmatic access
4. Web dashboard at `/dashboard` with Chart.js visualizations

The plans are sequenced:
- Wave 1 builds the foundation (IndexStats dataclass, CLI enhancements)
- Wave 2 adds API and terminal dashboard (depends on IndexStats)
- Wave 3 adds web UI (depends on API)

Plan 35-03 has a checkpoint requiring human verification of all three interfaces working together.

<next_action>
Resume with: `/gsd:execute-phase 35`

This will:
1. Detect no SUMMARYs exist, all plans incomplete
2. Start Wave 1 by spawning executor for 35-01
3. Continue through all waves
4. Present checkpoint for human verification after 35-03

Alternatively, to execute just one plan at a time:
- Create and use a single-plan executor command
